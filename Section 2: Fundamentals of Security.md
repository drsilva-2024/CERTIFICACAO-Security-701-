# Fundamentals of Security

## Objectives
- 1.1 - Compare and contrast various security controls
- 1.2 - Summarize fundamental security concepts

## Fundamentals of Security
- **Information Security**: Protecting data and information from unauthorized access, modification, disruption, disclosure, and destruction
- **Information Systems Security**: Protecting the systems (e.g., computers, servers, network devices) that hold and process critical data

## CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures information is accessible only to authorized personnel (e.g., encryption)
- **Integrity**: Ensures data remains accurate and unaltered (e.g., checksums)
- **Availability**: Ensures information and resources are accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy measures)

## Non-Repudiation
- Guarantees that an action or event cannot be denied by the involved parties (e.g., digital signatures)

## CIANA Pentagon
- An extension of the CIA triad with the addition of non-repudiation and authentication

## Triple Aâ€™s of Security
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system (e.g., password checks)
- **Authorization**: Determining actions or resources an authenticated user can access (e.g., permissions)
- **Accounting**: Tracking user activities and resource usage for audit or billing purposes

## Security Control Categories
- Technical, Managerial, Operational, Physical

## Security Control Types
- Preventative, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive

## Zero Trust Model
- Operates on the principle that no one should be trusted by default
- To achieve zero trust, we use the control plane and the data plane
  - **Control Plane**: Adaptive identity, threat scope reduction, policy-driven access control, and secured zones
  - **Data Plane**: Subject/system, policy engine, policy administrator, and establishing policy enforcement points
