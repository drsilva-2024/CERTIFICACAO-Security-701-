# Fundamentals of Security

## Objectives:

- **1.1** - Compare and contrast various types of security controls
- **1.2** - Summarize fundamental security concepts

## Fundamentals of Security

- **Information Security:** Protecting data and information from unauthorized access, modification, disruption, disclosure, and destruction
- **Information Systems Security:** Protecting the systems (e.g., computers, servers, network devices) that hold and process critical data
- **CIA Triad**
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensures info is accessible only to authorized personnel (e.g., encryption)
  - **Integrity:** Ensures data remains accurate and unaltered (e.g., checksums)
  - **Availability:** Ensures info and resources are accessible when needed (e.g., redundancy)
- **Non-Repudiation:** Guarantees that an action or event cannot be denied by the involved parties (e.g., digital signatures)
- **CIANA Pentagon:** Extension of CIA triad with non-repudiation and authentication
- **Triple Aâ€™s of Security**
  - **Authentication:** Verifying identity of a user or system (e.g., password checks)
  - **Authorization:** Determining actions or resources an authenticated user can access (e.g., permissions)
  - **Accounting:** Tracking user activities and resource usage for audit or billing purposes
- **Security Control Categories:** Technical, Managerial, Operational, Physical
- **Security Control Types:** Preventative, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive
- **Zero Trust Model:** Operates on the principle that no one should be trusted by default. Uses control and data planes.

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

### Threat
- Anything that could cause harm, loss, damage, or compromise to IT systems
- Can come from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, data integrity breaches, or disclosure

### Vulnerability
- Weakness in system design or implementation
- Can arise from software bugs, misconfigured software, or lack of physical security

### Risk Management
- Finding ways to minimize likelihood of an outcome and achieve desired outcome

## Confidentiality

- **Protection of information** from unauthorized access and disclosure
- Ensure private/sensitive info is not available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals/entities/processes
- **Methods:** Encryption, Access Controls, Data Masking, Physical Security, Training

## Integrity

- **Ensure information/data remain accurate** and unchanged
- **Methods:** Hashing, Digital Signatures, Checksums, Access Controls, Regular Audits

## Availability

- **Ensure info, systems, and resources are accessible** and operational when needed
- Strategies: Redundancy in systems and network designs

## Non-repudiation

- **Provide undeniable proof** in digital transactions
- **Importance:** Confirm authenticity, ensure integrity, provide accountability

## Authentication

- **Verify identity** of individuals or entities
- **Methods:** Knowledge, Possession, Inherence, Action, Location
- **MFA** for enhanced security

## Authorization

- **Permissions and privileges** granted to authenticated users/entities
- **Importance:** Protect sensitive data, maintain system integrity, create streamlined user experience

## Accounting

- **Track and record all user activities** during communication or transaction
- **Importance:** Create audit trail, maintain compliance, conduct forensic analysis, optimize resources, achieve user accountability

## Security Control Categories

- **Technical, Managerial, Operational, Physical**

## Security Control Types

- **Preventative, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive**

## Gap Analysis

- **Evaluate differences** between current and desired performance
- **Types:** Technical, Business

## Zero Trust

- **Verify every device, user, and transaction** within the network, regardless of origin
- Utilize Control and Data Planes
