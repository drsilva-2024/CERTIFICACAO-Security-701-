## Physical Security
Measures to protect tangible assets (buildings, equipment, people) from harm or unauthorized access.

### Security Controls
Measures to protect tangible assets (buildings, equipment, people) from harm or unauthorized access.

#### Fencing and Bollards
Barriers made of posts and wire or boards to enclose or separate areas.
-  **Bollards**: Short, sturdy vertical posts controlling or preventing vehicle access.
-  **Fences**: Barriers made of posts and wire or boards to enclose or separate areas.

#### Brute Force Attacks
Forcible entry, tampering with security devices, confronting security personnel, ramming a barrier with a vehicle.

#### Surveillance Systems
An organized strategy to observe and report activities. Components: Video surveillance.

### Security Guards

### Lighting
- Sensors
- Access Control Vestibules
  - Double-door system electronically controlled to allow only one door open at a time.
  - Prevents piggybacking and tailgating.
- Door Locks:  Padlocks, Pin and tumbler locks, Numeric locks, Wireless locks, Biometric locks, Cipher locks, Electronic access control systems
- Access Badges
  - Use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC) for access.

## Fencing and Bollards
Primitive tools employed to safeguard assets and people.

### Fence
Structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts.
- Provides a visual deterrent by defining a boundary that should not be violated by unauthorized personnel.
- Establishes a physical barrier against unauthorized entry.
- Effectively delays intruders, providing security personnel with a longer reaction time.

### Bollards
Robust, short vertical posts, typically made of steel or concrete, designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic.
- Fencing is adaptable and suited for safeguarding large perimeters.
- Bollards counter vehicular threats in a specific area.


## Attacking with Brute Force

**Brute Force**: Type of attack where access to a system is gained by simply trying all of the possibilities until you break through. In terms of physical security, brute force focuses on the following:

**Forcible Entry**: Act of gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically breaking or bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors, or fences. Use high-strength doors with deadbolt locks, metal frames, or a solid core.

**Tampering with security devices:** Involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited. To protect against tampering with security devices, have redundancy in physical security measures.

**Confronting security personnel:** Involves the direct confrontation or attack of your organization's security personnel. Security personnel should undergo rigorous conflict resolution and self-defense training to mitigate risks.

**Ramming barriers with vehicles:** Uses a car, truck, or other motorized vehicle to ram into the organization's physical security barriers, such as a fence, a gate, or even the side of your building. Install bollards or reinforced barriers to prevent vehicles from driving into your facilities.

## Surveillance Systems

**Surveillance System**: Organized strategy or setup designed to observe and report activities in a given area. Surveillance is often comprised of four main categories:

**Video Surveillance:** Can include motion detection, night vision, and facial recognition. Provides real-time visual feedback. A wired solution security camera is physically cabled from the device back to the central monitoring station. A wireless solution relies on Wi-Fi to send its signal back to the central monitoring station.

**Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) System**: Can move the camera or its angle to better detect issues during an intrusion. Best places to have cameras: data center, telecommunications closets, entrance or exit areas. Cameras should be configured to record what theyâ€™re observing.

**Security Guards:** Flexible and adaptable forms of surveillance that organizations use. Helps to reassure your staff or your customers that they are safe.

**Lighting:** Proper lighting is crucial for conducting effective surveillance using both video and security guards. If you create well-lit areas, this can deter criminals, reduce shadows and hiding spots, and enhance the quality of your video recordings.

**Sensors:** Devices that detect and respond to external stimuli or changes in the environment. There are four categories of sensors:

**Infrared Sensors:** Detect changes in infrared radiation that is often emitted by warm bodies like humans or animals.

**Pressure Sensors:** Activated whenever a specified minimum amount of weight is detected on the sensor that is embedded into the floor or a mat.

**Microwave Sensors:** Detect movement in an area by emitting microwave pulses and measuring their reflection off moving objects.

**Ultrasonic Sensors:** Measure the reflection of ultrasonic waves off moving objects.
